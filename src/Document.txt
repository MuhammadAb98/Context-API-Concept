1) First I have created a context using create context

Using this:
const CounterContext = createContext(1);

Create Context initialized it with 1


2) Then i imported it in main file App.js
3) Then i called parent and then from parent i called Child Component
4) Then i send the value of context using Provider
5) I also send the value using UseState

  By Writing:

  let CountState = useState(0);

  CountState[0] -> Have the value
  CountState[1] -> Have the function to update the parent value

6) I have Created a button that updated the value of the value
   from the parent by staying in child.
